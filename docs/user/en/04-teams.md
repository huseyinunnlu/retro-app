# Team Management

Learn how to invite team members, manage your team, and collaborate effectively.

## Understanding Teams

In Retro App, a **team** is your private workspace where:

- All team members can see and contribute to retros
- Comments and feedback are private to your team
- Everyone has access to all team retrospectives
- Collaboration happens in real-time

## Team Roles and Permissions

### Team Members

All team members can:

- View all team retros
- Create new retros
- Add, edit, and delete their own comments
- Move any comments between columns
- Participate in real-time collaboration

### Your Team Information

You can view your team details:

- **Team name**: Displayed in the sidebar
- **Team members**: See who's part of your team
- **Your role**: Your position within the team

## Inviting New Members

To add someone to your team:

### Step 1: Get the Invite Link

1. Look for **"Team Settings"** or **"Invite Members"** in your sidebar/menu
2. Find the **"Invite Link"** or **"Generate Invite"** option
3. Copy the invite link

The invite link looks like:

```
https://retro-app.com/register?token=abc123...&redirectTo=/
```

### Step 2: Share the Link

Send the invite link to new team members via:

- **Email**: Send directly to their work email
- **Chat**: Share in Slack, Teams, or your team chat
- **Message**: Send via any messaging platform

**Important**: Keep invite links private. Anyone with the link can join your team.

### Step 3: New Member Registration

When the new member clicks the link:

1. They're taken to the registration page
2. The invite code is automatically included
3. They fill in their details:
    - Full name
    - Email
    - Password
4. They click "Join Team"
5. They're automatically added to your team
6. They immediately see all team retros

## Managing Team Members

### Viewing Team Members

To see who's on your team:

1. Go to **Team Settings** or click your team name
2. View the list of all members
3. See their names and emails

### Removing Team Members

If you need to remove someone (admin/owner only):

1. Go to Team Settings
2. Find the member in the list
3. Look for a remove or delete option
4. Confirm removal

**Note**: The removed person loses access to all team retros immediately.

## Team Security

### Protecting Your Team Data

**Best practices:**

- Only invite trusted team members
- Don't share invite links publicly
- Regularly review who has access
- Use strong passwords
- Log out from shared computers

### Privacy

Your team's data is:

- **Private**: Only team members can see your retros
- **Isolated**: Other teams cannot access your workspace
- **Secure**: Protected by authentication

## Managing Your Team's Retros

### Team-Wide Visibility

All team members can:

- See all retros created by anyone on the team
- Open and contribute to any retro
- View all comments from all team members

### Organizing Team Retros

**Strategies:**

- **Naming conventions**: Use consistent names (e.g., "Sprint 1", "Sprint 2")
- **Regular schedule**: Create retros on the same day each sprint
- **Clear ownership**: Designate who creates each retro
- **Archive completed**: Keep the dashboard clean

### Team Collaboration Best Practices

**For effective teamwork:**

1. **Set expectations**
    - When to add comments (async vs. during meeting)
    - How often to review retros
    - What types of feedback are most valuable

2. **Communication**
    - Notify team when new retro is created
    - Remind about upcoming retro meetings
    - Share action items after discussions

3. **Engagement**
    - Encourage everyone to participate
    - Value all feedback equally
    - Follow up on action items
    - Celebrate improvements

## Switching Teams (If Supported)

If your account is part of multiple teams:

### Viewing Multiple Teams

- Look for a team switcher in the sidebar
- Click to see all your teams
- Select the team you want to work with

### Different Workspaces

Each team has its own:

- Set of retros
- Team members
- Private data

## Team Best Practices
