# Managing Your Retrospective

Learn how to add feedback, organize comments, and make the most of your retrospective sessions.

## Working with Comments

Comments (also called "cards") are the building blocks of your retrospective. They represent individual pieces of feedback or observations.

### Adding a Comment

**To add a new comment:**

1. Navigate to the retro you want to contribute to
2. Find the appropriate column for your feedback
3. Look for the text input area at the bottom of the column
4. Type your comment or feedback
5. Click **"Add Comment"** or press Enter
6. Your comment appears immediately as a card in the column

**Tips for good comments:**

- **One idea per card**: Keep each comment focused on a single topic
- **Be specific**: "Daily standups run too long" is better than "meetings are bad"
- **Use examples**: "The new deployment process saved us 2 hours" gives context
- **Stay constructive**: Focus on solutions, not just problems
- **Keep it brief**: Aim for 1-2 sentences

### Viewing Comments

All team members' comments appear in real-time:

- **Instant updates**: See new comments as they're added
- **No refresh needed**: The board updates automatically
- **All visible**: Everyone can see everyone's feedback

Each comment card shows:

- The text content
- Who added it (if displayed)
- When it was added

### Editing Your Comments

**To edit a comment you created:**

1. Find your comment on the board
2. Look for an **edit** button or icon (usually a pencil icon)
3. Click to edit
4. Modify the text
5. Save your changes

**Note**: You can only edit your own comments, not others'.

### Deleting Comments

**To remove a comment you created:**

1. Find your comment
2. Look for a **delete** button or icon (usually a trash can)
3. Click to delete
4. Confirm if prompted
5. The comment disappears immediately

**Important**:

- You can only delete your own comments
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Other team members will see the comment disappear in real-time

## Organizing with Drag and Drop

One of Retro App's most powerful features is the ability to move comments between columns.

### Why Move Comments?

- **Reclassify**: A comment might fit better in a different category
- **Group similar items**: Organize related feedback together
- **Correct mistakes**: Move a comment if it was added to the wrong column

### How to Move Comments

**Using drag and drop:**

1. Click and hold on a comment card
2. Drag it to another column
3. Release to drop it in the new column
4. The comment moves instantly

**What happens:**

- The comment immediately appears in the new column
- All team members see the move in real-time
- The comment's content stays the same

**Tips:**

- Dragging works on desktop and touch devices
- You can move any comment, not just your own
- Multiple people can move comments simultaneously

## Real-Time Collaboration

Retro App enables true real-time teamwork:

### Live Updates

**What updates in real-time:**

- New comments appear instantly
- Moved comments update for everyone
- Deleted comments disappear immediately
- Edits show up as they're saved

**No refresh needed**: Everything happens automatically.

### Seeing Who's Active

While multiple people can work at the same time, everyone sees the same board state:

- **Simultaneous adding**: Multiple people can add comments at once
- **Simultaneous moving**: Different people can rearrange cards
- **No conflicts**: The system keeps everything synchronized

### Best Practices for Team Collaboration

**During live meetings:**

1. **Silent generation**: Start with 5-10 minutes for everyone to add their thoughts
2. **Review together**: Go through each column as a group
3. **Group similar items**: Organize related comments by moving them together
4. **Discuss**: Talk about patterns and important themes
5. **Action items**: Decide what to do based on the feedback

**For async collaboration:**

1. **Add throughout the sprint**: Team members contribute as they think of things
2. **Review periodically**: Check the board during the week
3. **Formal review**: Hold a meeting to discuss accumulated feedback
4. **Document decisions**: Note what actions you'll take

## Facilitating a Retro Session

If you're leading a retro meeting, here's a suggested flow:

### Before the Meeting (5-10 minutes)

**Preparation:**

- Create the retro a day or two in advance
- Share the link with all participants
- Encourage async contributions
- Review previous retro's action items

### During the Meeting

#### 1. Silent Generation (5-10 minutes)

- Everyone adds their comments simultaneously
- No discussing yet—just capture thoughts
- Encourage specific, actionable feedback

#### 2. Review and Group (10-15 minutes)

- Read through all comments together
- Move similar items close to each other
- Ask clarifying questions
- Identify themes and patterns

#### 3. Discussion (15-20 minutes)

- Discuss the most important items
- Focus on actionable improvements
- Stay positive and constructive
- Ensure everyone's voice is heard

#### 4. Action Items (5-10 minutes)

- Decide on 2-3 concrete actions
- Assign owners to each action
- Set deadlines if appropriate
- Document in your note-taking tool

#### 5. Closing (2-3 minutes)

- Thank everyone for participating
- Remind about action items
- Schedule next retro

### After the Meeting

**Follow-up:**

- Share action items with the team
- Add action items to your project management tool
- Check progress before next retro
- Keep the retro accessible for reference

## Filtering and Focusing

### Dealing with Many Comments

For retros with lots of feedback:

**Organization strategies:**

- **Group by theme**: Move related comments near each other
- **Prioritize**: Focus discussion on most impactful items
- **Combine duplicates**: If multiple people mention the same thing, acknowledge it as important
- **Park off-topic items**: Note them for future discussion but keep the retro focused

### Identifying Patterns

Look for:

- **Repeated topics**: Multiple people mentioning the same issue
- **Themes**: Related concerns across different columns
- **Surprises**: Unexpected feedback
- **Quick wins**: Easy improvements to implement immediately

## Viewing History

### Accessing Past Retros

From your dashboard:

1. All previous retros are listed
2. Click any retro to open it
3. View all comments from that session
4. Use as reference for improvements

### Learning from History

**Useful for:**

- Tracking if action items were addressed
- Seeing if recurring issues were resolved
- Measuring team improvement over time
- Onboarding new team members

## Tips for Effective Retros

### Creating a Safe Environment

- **No blame**: Focus on processes, not people
- **Psychological safety**: Everyone should feel comfortable sharing
- **Confidentiality**: What's said in retro stays in retro
- **Equal voice**: Ensure quieter team members participate

### Keeping Retros Productive

**Do:**

- Focus on actionable improvements
- Celebrate what's working well
- Follow up on previous action items
- Keep to time limits
- Rotate facilitators

**Don't:**

- Let one person dominate
- Blame individuals
- Skip retros when busy (that's when you need them most!)
- Try to fix everything at once
- Forget to follow up on actions

### Making Retros Engaging

**Vary your approach:**

- Try different templates
- Change facilitators
- Mix up the format
- Add fun activities (if appropriate)
- Keep energy high

## Troubleshooting

### Comments Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**

- Connection issue
- Not logged in

**Solutions:**

- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Log out and back in

### Can't Move Comments

**Possible causes:**

- Browser compatibility
- Touch device limitations

**Solutions:**

- Try a different browser
- Use desktop if on mobile
- Check if drag-and-drop is working elsewhere on your system

### Changes Not Syncing

**Possible causes:**

- Network interruption
- Server issue

**Solutions:**

- Check your connection
- Refresh the page
- Wait a moment and try again

### Can't Delete/Edit Others' Comments

**This is by design:**

- You can only edit your own comments
- You can only delete your own comments
- Everyone can move any comment
