# Creating a Retrospective

This guide walks you through creating a new retrospective session in Retro App.

## What is a Retrospective?

A retrospective (or "retro") is a meeting where teams reflect on their recent work. Team members discuss:

- What went well
- What could be improved
- What actions to take next

Retros help teams learn from experiences and continuously improve.

## Starting a New Retro

### Step 1: Open the Create Dialog

1. From your dashboard, click the **"Create New Retro"** button
2. A dialog window will appear with the retro creation wizard

### Step 2: Choose a Template

Templates provide structure for your retrospective. Each template has different categories for organizing feedback.

**Available Templates:**

#### Start, Stop, Continue

The most popular retro format with three categories:

- **Start**: Things we should start doing
- **Stop**: Things we should stop doing
- **Continue**: Things we should keep doing

**When to use:**

- General team retrospectives
- Project reviews
- Process improvements

**More templates may be available** depending on your installation.

### Selecting a Template

1. Browse through the available templates
2. Each template shows:
    - **Cover image**: Visual representation
    - **Title**: Template name
    - **Description**: What it's used for
3. Click on a template to select it
4. Click **"Next"** to continue

### Step 3: Enter Retro Details

Give your retrospective a name to help identify it later.

**Name Ideas:**

- Include the sprint number: "Sprint 23 Retro"
- Include the date: "Q4 2024 Retrospective"
- Include the project: "Website Redesign Retro"
- Include the milestone: "Launch Retrospective"

**Tips for naming:**

- Be specific and descriptive
- Include dates or sprint numbers
- Use a consistent naming convention
- Keep it short but informative

**Example:**

```
Good: "Sprint 15 - Mobile App Feature"
Bad: "Retro" or "Meeting 1"
```

### Step 4: Create the Retro

1. Enter your retro name
2. Click **"Create"** or **"Finish"**
3. Your retro will be created and you'll be taken to it automatically

## After Creation

Once created, you'll see:

### The Retro Board

The board displays columns based on your chosen template. For "Start, Stop, Continue":

**Three columns:**

- **Start** (Green): Ideas for new initiatives
- **Stop** (Red): Things to eliminate
- **Continue** (Blue): Things working well

Each column has:

- A title and description
- An icon representing the category
- Space for comments/cards
- An input area to add new comments

### Adding Your First Comment

1. Find the appropriate column for your feedback
2. Click in the text area at the bottom of the column
3. Type your comment
4. Click **"Add Comment"** or press Enter
5. Your comment appears as a card in the column

**Comment Best Practices:**

- Be specific: Instead of "communication was bad", say "daily standups often started late"
- Be constructive: Focus on improvements, not blame
- Be honest: Share genuine observations
- Keep it brief: One thought per card

### Sharing with Your Team

Once your retro is created, share it with your team:

1. Copy the URL from your browser
2. Send it via:
    - Email
    - Slack/Teams message
    - Calendar invite
    - Team chat

Team members with accounts can access the retro and start adding their thoughts.

## Managing Multiple Retros

### Viewing All Retros

From the dashboard, you can:

- See all retros your team has created
- Sort by date (newest first)
- Click any retro to open it
- See which template each retro uses

### Organizing Retros

**Tips for organization:**

- Create one retro per sprint or milestone
- Archive old retros (if feature available)
- Use consistent naming for easy searching
- Review past retros before creating new ones

### Deleting Retros

If you need to remove a retro:

1. Open the retro
2. Look for the delete option (usually in settings or a menu)
3. Confirm deletion
4. **Note**: This action cannot be undone

## Best Practices for Effective Retros

### Before the Retro

- **Schedule it**: Set a recurring calendar event
- **Create early**: Give team time to add thoughts beforehand
- **Prepare**: Review previous action items

### During the Retro

- **Everyone participates**: Encourage all team members to contribute
- **Time-box**: Keep it focused (usually 30-60 minutes)
- **Stay positive**: Frame feedback constructively
- **Focus on actionable items**: What can we actually change?

### After the Retro

- **Document actions**: Note what you'll do differently
- **Assign owners**: Someone should be responsible for each action
- **Follow up**: Check progress in the next retro

## Common Use Cases

**Template**: Start, Stop, Continue
